    When the user installs a new version of the polyPod, we check whether
    they have already seen the update notification, and if not:

    1. Show it the next time the app is opened.
    2. Send a local push notification if the app is not opened within the
       specified delay.

    We determine whether the user has already seen a notification from its
    ID; so in order to show a notification with the next update, the ID
    needs to be changed manually to a value that's higher than all previously
    used values.

    To avoid mistakes, we use the polyEpoch at the time the notification is
    changed as its ID. The polyEpoch is defined as the number of seconds since
    midnight on 2019-05-04, UTC.

    If the notification ID is left unchanged, users who haven't seen it yet
    will still receive it, even if the content has been changed.

    If the notification ID is set to 0, no notifications will be shown at all.
