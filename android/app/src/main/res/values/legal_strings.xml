    <h3>II.
      General information about data processing</h3>
    <h4>1.
      Nature and extent of the collection and processing of personal data</h4>
    <p>In principle, we process the personal data of our users only insofar as
      this is necessary to provide a functioning website and our content and
      services. Personal data is collected and processed when you register for
      our newsletter or mailing lists. Furthermore, we store data that arises
      when using our service but only for statistical reasons, and in an
      anonymised manner. A creation of profiles, tracking, or other evaluation
      on the level of individual visitors does not take place.</p>
    <h4>2.
      Legal basis for the processing of personal data</h4>
    <p>We obtain the consent of the data subject for processing of personal data
      under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
      as legal basis. Insofar as processing of personal data is required to
      fulfill a legal obligation that is subject to polypoly, Art. 6 para. 1
      lit. c GDPR as legal basis. If processing is necessary to safeguard the
      legitimate interests of our company or a third party, and if the interest,
      fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject do not
      outweigh the former interest, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR as legal basis
      for processing.</p>
    <h4>3. Data
      deletion and storage duration</h4>
    <p>The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon
      as the purpose of the storage is deleted. It may also be stored if
      provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations,
      laws or other regulations to which polypoly is subject. A blocking or
      deletion of the data takes place also if a storage period prescribed by
      the cited standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of
      the data for a contract conclusion, or a contract fulfilment. Details can
      be found in the following sub-items.</p>

        <h3>III.
          Provision of Web services and creation of log files</h3>
        <h4>1.
          Description and scope of data processing</h4>
        <p>Each time you access our website, our system automatically collects
          data and information from the computer system of the accessing
          computer.</p>
        <p>The following data will be collected:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Information about polyPod version or the browser type and the
            version used</li>
          <li>The operating system of your computer</li>

            ("referrers")</li>
          <li>Websites accessed by your system through our website</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The data is stored temporarily in the log files of our system, and
          not stored together with other personal data.</p>
        <h4>2. Purpose of
          data processing</h4>
        <p>The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to
          enable delivery of the website to your computer. For this purpose, the
          IP address of your computer must remain stored for the duration of the
          session. Log files are stored to ensure the functionality of the
          website and the security of our information technology systems. We do
          not use IP addresses to identify you. The data is not evaluated for
          marketing purposes.</p>
        <h4>3. Legal
          basis for data processing</h4>
        <p>The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is
          Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>
        <h4>4. Duration of storage</h4>
        <p>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to
          achieve the purpose for which they were collected.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the case of the collection of data to provide the website, this
            is the case when the respective session is terminated.</li>
          <li>If the IP address is stored in log files, this is the case after
            45 days at the latest.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>5.
          Possibility of opposition and removal</h4>
        <p>The collection of data for the provision of the website and the
          storage of data in log files is mandatory for the operation of the
          website. Consequently, there is no possibility of opposition.</p>

                  pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR and it has not yet been
                  established whether the legitimate reasons of the data

                with the above conditions, you will be informed by us before the
                restriction is lifted.</p>

                17 (1) GDPR, he shall take appropriate measures, including
                technical measures, taking into account the available technology

                the person concerned, have requested them to delete all links to
                this personal data or copies or replications of this personal

              <h5>c) Exceptions</h5>
              <p>The right to deletion does not exist if the processing is
                necessary</p>
              <ol>
                <li>to the exercise of freedom of expression and of information;</li>
                <li>to fulfil a legal obligation which the processing requires
                  under the law of the Union or of the Member States to which
                  the controller is subject or to perform a task carried out in
                  the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
                  vested in the controller;</li>
                <li>on grounds of public interest in the field of public health

                <li>for archival purposes in the public interest, scientific or
                  historical research purposes or for statistical purposes

                  to under section a) presumably makes it impossible or
                  seriously impairs the attainment of the objectives of such
                  processing, or</li>
                <li>for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>5. Right to
                information</h4>
              <p>If you have exercised the right to correction, deletion or
                limitation of processing against us, we are obliged to notify
                all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have
                been disclosed of this correction, deletion or limitation of
                processing, unless this proves impossible or involves
                disproportionate effort.</p>
              <p>You have the right to be informed about these recipients.</p>
              <h4>6.
                Right to data transferability</h4>
              <p>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you
                that you have provided to us in a structured, common and
                machine-readable format. In addition, you have the right to
                communicate this data to another responsible person without
                being hindered by the responsible person to whom the personal
                data has been provided, provided that</p>
              <ol>
                <li>the processing is based on a consent pursuant to Art. 6
                  para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR or on a
                  contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR and</li>
                <li>processing is carried out using automated procedures.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>In exercising this right, you also have the right to request
                that the personal data concerning you be transmitted directly by
                one responsible person to another responsible person, insofar as
                this is technically feasible. Freedoms and rights of other
                persons must not be affected by this. The right to data transfer
                does not apply to the processing of personal data necessary for
                the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or
                in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</p>
              <h4>7. Right to object</h4>
              <p>You have the right, for reasons arising from your particular
                situation, to object at any time to the processing of personal
                data concerning you on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f
                GDPR. We will no longer process your personal data unless we can
                prove compelling reasons for the processing worthy of protection
                which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the
                processing serves the assertion, exercise or defence of legal
                claims.</p>
              <h4>8.
                Right to withdraw data protection consent</h4>
              <p>You have the right to revoke your privacy statement at any
                time. The revocation of consent does not affect the legality of
                the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the
                revocation.</p>
              <h4>9.
                Right of appeal to a supervisory authority</h4>
              <p>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial
                remedy, you have the right to complain to a supervisory
                authority, in particular in the Member State where you reside,
                at your place of work or at the place where the alleged
                infringement is alleged, if you consider that the processing of
                your personal data is in breach of the GDPR. The supervisory
                authority with which the complaint was lodged will inform the
                complainant of the status and outcome of the complaint,
                including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Art. 78
                GDPR.</p>
