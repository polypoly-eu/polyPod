In the occassion you are running a windows platform, we will have to make a few fixes for your machine to be able to build this app:

1. Please make sure you have installed git on your machine.
2. Open cmd with administrator privilages (Right click on cmd -> run as administrator).
3. Set your current working directory to this folder ( "cd {path root of polypod}/windows-utils") and run the replace-symlinks.js file with node. 
4. You should recieve an output saying "All set up!".
5. Go back to the root folder and run build.js (cd ..).
6. Happy building!
