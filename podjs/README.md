# pod.js

A polyPod implementation that runs in a regular web browser.

## Reasoning

The polyPod uses a lot of web technologies under the hood, and modern browsers
ship with very powerful development tools, which makes web browsers the ideal
environment for developing polyPod features.

As for production use: A lot of features don't make sense in isolation, yet
those that do can be easily deployed on a HTTP server by using `pod.js`.

## Limitations

Currently, any feature including `pod.js` will become a fully functional
polyPod, except for one thing: It only runs a single feature. While we could
support the creation of a container and a mechanism for loading features in
`pod.js` without too much trouble, it is currently not implemented.

The `polyOut` and `polyNav` interfaces are not implemented at the moment. The
former because we don't use it yet, the latter because it is currently not part
of the `Pod` interface, which we aim to rectify soon.

## Building

Simply run `build.js` in the repository root.

## Usage

1. Add _podjs_ as a development dependency to your feature.
2. Copy or link `node_modules/@polypoly-eu/podjs/dist/pod.js`.
3. Include `pod.js` from you feature's main document - before the feature's own
   code.
