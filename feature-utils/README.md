# Feature utilities

These are a variety of libraries used in the various bundled polyPod Features
we've developed. If you're in the process of building your own Feature, you
might find some of these useful.

The following utilities are all used in production by multiple existing
Features, and are reasonably well documented:

[##poly-import](https://polypoly-eu.github.io/polyPod/feature-utils/poly-import)

A library used to parse and pre-process raw data.

[##poly-analysis](https://polypoly-eu.github.io/polyPod/feature-utils/poly-analysis)

A library used to analyse and enrich data.

[##poly-look](https://polypoly-eu.github.io/polyPod/feature-utils/poly-look)

A visual component library for polyPod Features.

[##silly-i18n](https://polypoly-eu.github.io/polyPod/feature-utils/silly-i18n)

A simple i18n library.

## Experimental utilities

Utilities not listed above aren't widely (if at all) used or sufficiently
documented yet. You probably want to stay away from them :)
