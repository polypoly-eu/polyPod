<h3>II.
  General information about data processing</h3>
<h4>1.
  Nature and extent of the collection and processing of personal data</h4>
<p>In principle, we process the personal data of our users only insofar as
  this is necessary to provide a functioning website and our content and
  services. Personal data is collected and processed when you register for
  our newsletter or mailing lists. Furthermore, we store data that arises
  when using our service but only for statistical reasons, and in an
  anonymised manner. A creation of profiles, tracking, or other evaluation
  on the level of individual visitors does not take place.</p>
<h4>2.
  Legal basis for the processing of personal data</h4>
<p>We obtain the consent of the data subject for processing of personal data
  under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
  as legal basis. Insofar as processing of personal data is required to
  fulfill a legal obligation that is subject to polypoly, Art. 6 para. 1
  lit. c GDPR as legal basis. If processing is necessary to safeguard the
  legitimate interests of our company or a third party, and if the interest,
  fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject do not
  outweigh the former interest, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR as legal basis
  for processing.</p>
<h4>3. Data
  deletion and storage duration</h4>
<p>The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon
  as the purpose of the storage is deleted. It may also be stored if
  provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations,
  laws or other regulations to which polypoly is subject. A blocking or
  deletion of the data takes place also if a storage period prescribed by
  the cited standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of
  the data for a contract conclusion, or a contract fulfilment. Details can
  be found in the following sub-items.</p>

    <h4>2. Purpose of
      data processing</h4>
    <p>The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to
      enable delivery of the website to your computer. For this purpose, the
      IP address of your computer must remain stored for the duration of the
      session. Log files are stored to ensure the functionality of the
      website and the security of our information technology systems. We do
      not use IP addresses to identify you. The data is not evaluated for
      marketing purposes.</p>
    <h4>3. Legal
      basis for data processing</h4>
    <p>The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is
      Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>
    <h4>4. Duration of storage</h4>
    <p>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to
      achieve the purpose for which they were collected.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the case of the collection of data to provide the website, this
        is the case when the respective session is terminated.</li>
      <li>If the IP address is stored in log files, this is the case after
        45 days at the latest.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>5.
      Possibility of opposition and removal</h4>
    <p>The collection of data for the provision of the website and the
      storage of data in log files is mandatory for the operation of the
      website. Consequently, there is no possibility of opposition.</p>

    <li>Error analysis in order to solve technical problems</li>
  </ul>

    basis for data processing</h4>

    inquiries is the fulfillment of a contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 b
    DSGVO.</p>
  <p>If requests are not based on a contract, the legal basis is the
    safegarding of our legitimate interests pursuant to Art 6 para 1 lit f
    DSGVO.</p>
  <h4>4. Duration of storage</h4>
  <p>All personal data transmitted to us in the context of customer support
    will be automatically deleted six months after the last activity in the
    respective support case, unless we are obliged to further storage due to
    commercial and tax law reasons.</p>

    your personal data that you have transmitted to us. Further detailed

              pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR and it has not yet been

            this personal data or copies or replications of this personal
            data.</p>
          <h5>c) Exceptions</h5>
          <p>The right to deletion does not exist if the processing is
            necessary</p>
          <ol>
            <li>to the exercise of freedom of expression and of information;</li>
            <li>to fulfil a legal obligation which the processing requires
              under the law of the Union or of the Member States to which
              the controller is subject or to perform a task carried out in
              the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
              vested in the controller;</li>
            <li>on grounds of public interest in the field of public health
              pursuant to Article 9(2)(h) and (i) and Article 9(3) GDPR;</li>
            <li>for archival purposes in the public interest, scientific or
              historical research purposes or for statistical purposes
              pursuant to Art. 89 para. 1 GDPR, insofar as the law referred
              to under section a) presumably makes it impossible or
              seriously impairs the attainment of the objectives of such
              processing, or</li>
            <li>for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>5. Right to
            information</h4>
          <p>If you have exercised the right to correction, deletion or
            limitation of processing against us, we are obliged to notify
            all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have
            been disclosed of this correction, deletion or limitation of
            processing, unless this proves impossible or involves
            disproportionate effort.</p>
          <p>You have the right to be informed about these recipients.</p>
          <h4>6.
            Right to data transferability</h4>
          <p>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you
            that you have provided to us in a structured, common and
            machine-readable format. In addition, you have the right to
            communicate this data to another responsible person without
            being hindered by the responsible person to whom the personal
            data has been provided, provided that</p>
          <ol>
            <li>the processing is based on a consent pursuant to Art. 6
              para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR or on a
              contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR and</li>
            <li>processing is carried out using automated procedures.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>In exercising this right, you also have the right to request
            that the personal data concerning you be transmitted directly by
            one responsible person to another responsible person, insofar as
            this is technically feasible. Freedoms and rights of other
            persons must not be affected by this. The right to data transfer
            does not apply to the processing of personal data necessary for
            the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or
            in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</p>
          <h4>7. Right to object</h4>
          <p>You have the right, for reasons arising from your particular
            situation, to object at any time to the processing of personal
            data concerning you on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f
            GDPR. We will no longer process your personal data unless we can
            prove compelling reasons for the processing worthy of protection
            which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the
            processing serves the assertion, exercise or defence of legal
            claims.</p>
          <h4>8.
            Right to withdraw data protection consent</h4>
          <p>You have the right to revoke your privacy statement at any
            time. The revocation of consent does not affect the legality of
            the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the
            revocation.</p>
          <h4>9.
            Right of appeal to a supervisory authority</h4>
          <p>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial
            remedy, you have the right to complain to a supervisory
            authority, in particular in the Member State where you reside,
            at your place of work or at the place where the alleged
            infringement is alleged, if you consider that the processing of
            your personal data is in breach of the GDPR. The supervisory
            authority with which the complaint was lodged will inform the
            complainant of the status and outcome of the complaint,
            including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Art. 78
            GDPR.</p>
