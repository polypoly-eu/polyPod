# polyPod assets

These files are being used in the different platform specific implementations of
the polyPod, as well as in our bundled Features - primarily so that we don't
have to track identical files multiple times.

In most cases, these assets are not being copied to their corresponding `dist`
directories at build time, but rather have symbolic links pointing to them.

## Licenses

Please check [the assets license file](../3rd-party-licenses/assets-licenses.txt)
for information on the licenses every asset uses.
