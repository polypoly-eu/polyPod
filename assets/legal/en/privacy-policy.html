<h2>II. General information about data processing</h2>
<h3>1. Nature and extent of the collection and processing of personal data</h3>
<p>In  principle, we process the personal data of our users only insofar as  this is necessary to provide a functioning website and our content and  services. Personal data is collected and processed when you register for  our newsletter or mailing lists. Furthermore, we store data that arises  when using our service but only for statistical reasons, and in an  anonymised manner. A creation of profiles, tracking, or other evaluation  on the level of individual visitors does not take place.</p>

If processing is necessary to  safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or a third party, and  if the interest, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the data  subject do not outweigh the former interest, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR  as legal basis for processing.</p>
<h3>3. Data deletion and storage duration</h3>

<h2>VIII. Data processing when sharing data for research and development</h2>
<h3>1. Description and scope of data processing</h3>
<p>By  default your data gets only stored and processed locally on your device  by polyPod. Some features of polyPod (e.g., Facebook importer) may  allow you to actively share certain data with polypoly to help with our  research and development of polyPod.</p>
<p>Sharding  of this data with polypoly is done on a voluntary basis and you can  decide on a case-by-case basis whether and which data you share.</p>
<p>Examples of the data that may be shared are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the name of the company that provided the data to you (Facebook, Amazon, etc.)</li>
<li>names of features or services you've used in relation to the company that provided the data to you</li>
<li>metadata such as file names, file size, number of files, language, character set, timestamps or version information</li>
<li>field names and data schemas</li>
<li>metadata generated by polyPod about data imports such as error codes and which analyses could not be applied to the data</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal data, i.e., values of data structures and contents of files will not be included in any of the shared data. </p>
<p>If  you share data, it is uploaded directly by the polyPod to a polypoly  system where it gets stored without any reference to you personally or  your device.</p>
<p>For each upload our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the accessing computer according to section <em>III. Provision of Web services and creation of log files</em> of this privacy policy with the exception that your IP address will only be stored in abbreviated form (or not at all). This  data is stored temporarily in the log files of our system, and not  stored together with other personal data. Please see section III. of  this privacy policy for further details about log files.</p>
<h3>2. Purpose of data processing</h3>
<p>polypoly uses the shared data to help with their research and development of polyPod and related products.</p>
<p>We do not use IP addresses or the shared data to identify you. The data is not evaluated for marketing purposes.</p>
<h3>3. Legal basis for data processing</h3>
<p>The legal basis for processing the shared data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>
<h3>4. Duration of storage</h3>
<p>The shared data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for the purpose of research and development.</p>
<h3>5. Possibility of opposition and removal</h3>
<p>The  shared data is stored without any reference to you personally or to  your device. Consequently, there is no possibility of opposition or  removal.</p>
<h2>IX. Other transmission of data to third parties</h2>
<p>polypoly does  not pass on any personal data to third parties unless there is a legal  obligation to do so. We do not sell or market any personal data. </p>
<h2>X. Rights of the data subject</h2>

<ol>
<li>if  you dispute the accuracy of the personally identifiable information  about you for a period of time that allows us to verify the accuracy of  the personally identifiable information;</li>

If the processing restriction has been restricted in  accordance with the above conditions, you will be informed by us before  the restriction is lifted.</p>
<h3>4. Right to erasure</h3>
<p>You  may request us to delete your personal information immediately and we  are obligated to delete that information immediately for any of the  following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personal data concerning you are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.</li>

</ol>

<p>The right to deletion does not exist if the processing is necessary</p>
<ol>
<li>to the exercise of freedom of expression and of information;</li>
<li>to  fulfil a legal obligation which the processing requires under the law  of the Union or of the Member States to which the controller is subject  or to perform a task carried out in the public interest or in the  exercise of official authority vested in the controller;</li>
<li>on grounds of public interest in the field of public health pursuant to Article 9(2)(h) and (i) and Article 9(3) GDPR;</li>
<li>for  archival purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical  research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 para. 1  GDPR, insofar as the law referred to under section a) presumably makes  it impossible or seriously impairs the attainment of the objectives of  such processing, or</li>
<li>for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
</ol>
<h3>5. Right to information</h3>
<p>If  you have exercised the right to correction, deletion or limitation of  processing against us, we are obliged to notify all recipients to whom  the personal data concerning you have been disclosed of this correction,  deletion or limitation of processing, unless this proves impossible or  involves disproportionate effort.</p>
<p>You have the right to be informed about these recipients.</p>
<h3>6. Right to data transferability</h3>
<p>You  have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you  have provided to us in a structured, common and machine-readable format.  In addition, you have the right to communicate this data to another  responsible person without being hindered by the responsible person to  whom the personal data has been provided, provided that</p>
<ol>
<li>the  processing is based on a consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR  or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 para.  1 lit. b GDPR and</li>
<li>processing is carried out using automated procedures.</li>
</ol>
<p>In  exercising this right, you also have the right to request that the  personal data concerning you be transmitted directly by one responsible  person to another responsible person, insofar as this is technically  feasible. Freedoms and rights of other persons must not be affected by  this. The right to data transfer does not apply to the processing of  personal data necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the  public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the  controller.</p>
<h3>7. Right to object</h3>
<p>You  have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to  object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you on  the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f GDPR. We will no longer process  your personal data unless we can prove compelling reasons for the  processing worthy of protection which outweigh your interests, rights  and freedoms, or the processing serves the assertion, exercise or  defence of legal claims.</p>
<h3>8. Right to withdraw data protection consent</h3>
<p>You  have the right to revoke your privacy statement at any time. The  revocation of consent does not affect the legality of the processing  carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.</p>
<h3>9. Right of appeal to a supervisory authority</h3>
<p>Without  prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the  right to complain to a supervisory authority, in particular in the  Member State where you reside, at your place of work or at the place  where the alleged infringement is alleged, if you consider that the  processing of your personal data is in breach of the GDPR. The  supervisory authority with which the complaint was lodged will inform  the complainant of the status and outcome of the complaint, including  the possibility of a judicial remedy under Art. 78 GDPR.</p>
