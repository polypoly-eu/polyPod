# PolyPod platform core

Logic shared across polyPod platforms: iOS and Android.

## Requirements

-   [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Core is built with Rust 1.63.0.
-   The build prerequisites for [FlatBuffers](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers), currently primarily a C++ toolchain.

## Building

It is required to run `make` in a bash terminal which contains the necessary
dependencies - curl, make, unzip. MacOS and Linux systems terminal should
already have everything needed. On Windows, a terminal application like
[GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org) is needed.

- Building rust core:
```
make rust_core
```

- Building swift core:
```
make ios_bindings
```

- Building android core:

    Prerequisite: You should install NDK (it is recommended to use Android Studio for installing it). Version r25 should be installed. Make sure that either `NDK_HOME` or `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`(specifying the path to NDK) is exported as an environment variable on your system.

```shell
make android_bindings
```

- Building for all platforms:

```shell
make
```

## Testing

Just run:

    cargo test
