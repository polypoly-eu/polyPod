# pod-api

Definition, spec, and default implementation of the polyPod API

## Overview

This repository defines the interface between the polyPod and Features. As far
as reasonably possible, we try to stick to existing APIs, for example
[RDFJS](http://rdf.js.org/) for querying and storing data.

Features run in a sandboxed browsing context, which means they have access to a
lot of the usual browser APIs, but things such as data storage and external
communication need to go through the polyPod API, i.e. an implementation of the
`Pod` interface as specified here. The concrete polyPod implementations, such as the
polyPod for Android, expose objects that implement the `Pod` interface to
the Feature.

## Structure

This repository is structured as a TypeScript library with the following
modules:

-   `api` contains type definitions, describing the shape of the interfaces
    -   `fs` defines the filesystem operations
    -   `fetch` defines the [Fetch]-compatible API for sending HTTP(S) requests
-   `feature` contains additional type definitions for the DOM that Features can
    expect
-   `fs` provides a minimal filesystem interface that works across JS implementations.
-   `default` provides a minimal reference implementation (excluding the DOM
    interface)
-   `spec` is a conformance test for API implementations (excluding the DOM
    interface)
