 * `PolyIn` specifies the interaction of the Feature with the Pod store. It is concerned with creating and manipulating
 * RDF triples according to the [RDFJS](http://rdf.js.org/) specification.
 *
 * Features _must_ use the [[Pod.dataFactory]] to create any RDF term they intend to pass to the interface, e.g. for
 * querying and storing, or alternatively re-use RDF terms that have been obtained through PolyIn via other means. It is
 * not allowed to use other data factory implementations.
 *
 * Features _may_ rely on the convention that all RDF triples stored in the Pod are associated with the default graph.
 * In other words, when querying for quads, for all returned quads, the expression `q.graph.equals(factory.defaultGraph())`
 * will hold true. Conversely, Features _should_ only attempt to store quads with the default graph in the Pod, since
 * storage is otherwise not guaranteed.
 *
 * The Pod may impose additional restrictions on the shape of RDF terms that may be stored or queried, for example
 * access control based on IRIs. The Pod may also store additional metadata that is not reified in the RDF data model,
 * e.g. timestamps and origin of read or write access for the purpose of auditing. Features _should not_ confuse empty
 * queries with lack of data, as query results may additionally be filtered.
 *
 * Using blank nodes or variables in any position results in implementation-defined behaviour and should not be relied
 * on, except for internal purposes of the Feature.

/**
 * This interface represents the API that a Pod offers to a Feature. It comprises multiple sub-components that are
 * concerned with different aspects. Those sub-components are grouped according to data flow (see member documentation
 * for details).
 *
 * Pod implementors may use any technology they see fit to provide the API, including remote procedure calls or HTTP
 * requests, as long as that is transparent to the Features. To that extent, the API is designed to be asynchronous,
 * i.e. all methods return promises. The only exception is the RDF data factory; see [[Pod.dataFactory]] for details.
 *
 * The API is provided to the Feature as a global variable (`window.pod`). The API is initialized eagerly. The Feature
 * is required to include a `script` tag referencing a well-known path to a JavaScript file in order
 * for the API to be bootstrapped properly:
 *
 * ```html
 * <script src="/pod.js"></script>
 * ```
 *
 * The Feature should load this script file before any custom code is executed. Otherwise, the
 * presence of the `window.pod` object is not guaranteed. It should be noted that asynchronous calls
 * to the Pod APIs may only be resolved when the `load` event of the document has triggered.
 *
 * This notwithstanding, Features may carry out custom initialization logic that does not depend on
 * the API concurrently.

    /**
     * A [spec-compliant](http://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/) data factory that is _not_ guaranteed to support variables.
     *

     * ```
     * const quad = factory.quad(
     *   factory.namedNode("http://example.org/s"),
     *   factory.namedNode("http://example.org/p"),
     *   factory.namedNode("http://example.org/o")
     * );
     * ```
     *
     * The factory is an exception in that it is synchronous as opposed to the general asynchronous [[Pod]] API. This is
     * by design for these reasons:
     *
     * 1. Features may construct a large number of RDF terms. Eventually, those will likely be saved in the Pod using
     *    the [[add]] call. Round-tripping the construction of those terms across an asynchronous boundary will lead
     *    to an unacceptable runtime overhead.
     * 2. There are many small, self-contained data factory implementations that can be shipped with Pods, for example
     *    [@rdfjs/data-model](https://github.com/rdfjs-base/data-model). The Polypoly `rdf-spec` package can be used to
     *    ensure correctness of the factory implementations.
     * 3. There is no point in imposing access-control over manipulation of RDF terms before they are stored in the Pod.
     * 4. Pod implementors may choose to provide a custom implementation for more efficient serialization of RDF terms
     *    that are passed into the Pod. This is much easier to implement when the Pod controls the creation of terms.
     *
     * Pertaining to the last point, Features _must_ use the factory to create new RDF terms.
