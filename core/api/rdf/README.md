TypeScript implementation of the RDF Data Model spec

## Overview

This repository provides a minimal implementation of the [RDFJS Data Model Spec]
that is tested against the [executable specification].

It is mostly a clone of the [reference implementation], improving upon it in two
ways:

1. implemented in TypeScript and mechanically tested against the spec
2. the resulting objects are instances of exported classes (see documentation
   for details)

## Example

```typescript
import {dataFactory} from "@polypoly-eu/rdf";

const subject = dataFactory.namedNode('http://example.org/subject');
const predicate = dataFactory.namedNode('http://example.org/predicate');
const object = dataFactory.namedNode('http://example.org/object');
const graph = dataFactory.namedNode('http://example.org/graph');
const quad = dataFactory.quad(subject, predicate, object, graph);
```
