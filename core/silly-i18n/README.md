# silly-i18n

A stupidly simple i18n module, following the format and API of i18next.

It's so silly, we probably shouldn't even be having this. The main reason is
that i18next seemed fairly heavy for our needs at the time we wrote this. We
will presumably outgrow this package before too long and switch to a proper
third party translation library. If this is still around after 2021, I will feel
pretty silly.
