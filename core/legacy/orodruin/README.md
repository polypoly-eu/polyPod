CLI tool supporting the development lifecycle of Features

## Installing (optional)

Features working with the `orodruin` command typically install it as a
dependency, but if you would like to work with the command directly, you can
install it globally:

```
$ npm install -g
$ orodruin --help
```

## Developing Features

After building orodruin, you can use it to develop features. See
[the example feature](../../../features/example).
