    "section2.description": "Amazon ranks as one of the biggest data oligarchs of our time. To weaken such monopolies, we need to bring the data – your data – back into our country. So once you have loaded your data into your polyPod, you take away the sole control from companies like Amazon – and thus weaken their monopoly position. \n\nIn the first step, you download a copy of your data from Amazon to your polyPod to find out what Amazon actually knows about you.\nIn the future, you will then have the option of deleting your data from Amazon and deciding for yourself what data you make available.",
