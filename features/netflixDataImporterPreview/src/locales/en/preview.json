    "section2.description": "As the world's largest streaming provider in its industry, Netflix is thus also one of the big data oligarchs of our time. \n\nHowever, you should not only have control over your media library, but also over your data. The first step is to download a copy of your data from Netflix into your polyPod to find out what Netflix actually knows about you.\nIn the future, you will then have the option to delete your data from Netflix and decide for yourself what data you make available. Thus, you not only regain control over your data, but also weaken the monopoly position of such companies, as they now no longer have sole control over it.",

Become a crowd-investor and thus a co-owner of the technology, then register for beta testing afterwards.",
