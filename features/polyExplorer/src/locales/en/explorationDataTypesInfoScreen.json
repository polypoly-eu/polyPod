        "Sharing information is a key element of the current data economy. Some of that sharing is needed, useful, and in the best interest of the users as well (e.g. to protect you against credit card fraud). But not all of it is. Often data is gathered and shared that does not relate to your interactions. By far most of the time the interest behind that is advertising."
