    "treemap": "This diagram is called a <strong>treemap</strong> and displays hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles. Each branch of the structure is represented by a rectangle, which is then broken down into smaller rectangles representing sub-branches. Areas of rectangles are proportional to the value they represent. Colors separate rectangles or branches from one another."
