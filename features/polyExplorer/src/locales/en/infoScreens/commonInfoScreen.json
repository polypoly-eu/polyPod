    "circle.packing": "This diagram is called a <strong>packed circle</strong> chart or <strong>circular treemap</strong>. It displays hierarchical data as a set of nested circles. Each branch of the structure is represented by a circle, which is then broken down into smaller circles representing sub-branches. Areas of circles are proportional to the value they represent. Colors separate circles or branches from one another.",
    "treemap": "This diagram is called a <strong>treemap</strong> and displays hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles. Each branch of the structure is represented by a rectangle, which is then broken down into smaller rectangles representing sub-branches. Areas of rectangles are proportional to the value they represent. Colors separate rectangles or branches from one another.",
    "bubble.chart": "This diagram is called a <strong>bubble chart</strong>. Each bubble represents one datatype. The number of bubbles shows how many data types there are. The size of each bubble is dependent on the amount of data inside.",
    "bar.chart": "This diagram is called a <strong>bar chart</strong>. The length of each bar is proportional to the values that it represents. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured value."
