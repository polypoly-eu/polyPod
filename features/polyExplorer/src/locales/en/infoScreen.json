This research is also informed by the work of others in this field e.g. XXX?</p><p>For the current version of polyExplorer we selected 5 companies and present them as \"featured\".

Regarding ambiguous statements in privacy policies, we have aimed to use the W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary (in short: DPV) to the appropriate level of granularity. For example, when a vague statement could be referring to a number of datatypes, we chose the DPV term that covers the possibilities more generally.</p>",
