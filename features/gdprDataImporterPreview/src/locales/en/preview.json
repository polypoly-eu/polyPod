    "section1.description": "With the GDPR data importers you can load a copy of your data from data oligarchs onto your device – in other words, you bring your data back to your country. Every data set that is downloaded is no longer exclusively available to the “Data Harvesters“, and their market position is thus severely weakened. ",

    "section2.description": "Your data capital, i.e. the amount of data you have at your disposal, increases every time you use one of the GDPR Data Importers. The more data capital the polyPod users own, the more interesting data analyses become for companies. And the more companies analyse, the higher the potential income for you, if you want to rent out your computing power or your data.\n\nIn the future, there will not only be more GDPR Data Importers, but their function will also be expanded.\n\n\u2022 Direct download of data within your polyPod.\n\u2022 Automatic request for further data, should a data oligarch have forgotten to hand over all data.\n\u2022 Automatic deletion, including tracking whether the deletion has actually taken place.",
