# polyPod Features

These are various Features that can run in the polyPod. Most are bundled with it
and part of its core functionality, but some are just for testing or
documentation purposes.

## Creating a new Feature

See [../docs/build-a-feature.md](../docs/build-a-feature.md).

## Bundling a Feature

At the moment, no platform supports Feature installation. So the only way to
deploy a Feature in an environment other than [pod.js](../platform/podjs), is to
add it to the [bundle](bundle).
