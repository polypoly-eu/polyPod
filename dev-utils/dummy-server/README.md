# dummy-server

This is a mock server that's used throughout the rest of the polyPod when something needs to be tested against a real web server.

## Install

Do the usual

    npm ci

## Run

If this is installed as a dependency, there will be two scripts installed for you to use:

    start-dummy-server

will start it,

    stop-dummy-server

will, you guessed it, stop it
